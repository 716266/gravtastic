h1. Gravtastic

Easily add "Gravatars":http://gravatar.com to your Ruby application.

h2. Install

  sudo gem install chrislloyd-gravtastic --source=http://gems.github.com

h2. Example

Somewhere in your application you need to @require 'gravtastic'@. In Rails 2.1 can forego this and just add a dependency gem dependency for Gravtastic.

  Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
    config.gem 'chrislloyd-gravtastic', :lib => 'gravtastic', :source => 'http://gems.github.com/'
  end

The next step is to make your class (or model in Rails) have a Gravatar.

  class User
    has_gravatar
  end
  
This defaults to looking for the gravatar ID on the @email@ method. So, if your @User@ has an @email@ then it will send that to Gravatar to get their picture. You can change the default gravatar source like this:

  has_gravatar :on => :author_email

Now your gravatar source is all set up! If you are working with Rails you can now use some of Gravtastic's handy helpers to display the image in your views.

  = gravatar_image current_user
  = gravatar_image current_user, :options => { :width => 80, :height => 80 }
  = gravatar_path current_user # => http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08f077ea061585744ee080824f5a8e65


h2. Contribute

You can checkout the source or fork it yourself from Github.

  git clone git://github.com/chrislloyd/gravtastic.git

I'm going to put my foot down and say that I won't accept any patches unless they are in the format of a pull request from your repo.
